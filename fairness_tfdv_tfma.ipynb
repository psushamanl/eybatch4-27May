    "When releasing a machine learning model, it's critical to ensure its performance as well as its behavior. On top of traditional model evaluation, a responsible evaluation of a model requires assessing that data and model are fair, i.e. they avoid creating or reinforcing bias. Bias occurs when there is stereotyping, prejudice, or favoritism towards some things, people, or groups over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you perform an initial fairness analysis on the [Civil Comments dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/civil_comments) using two tools offered by TensorFlow for large-scale ML analysis:\n",
    "- [TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started) (TFDV) can analyze training and serving data to compute descriptive statistics, infer a schema, and detect data anomalies.<br>You use TFDV to find potential issues that can lead to fairness disparities, such as missing values and data imbalances.\n",
    "- [TensorFlow Model Analysis](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/tfma) (TFMA) can perform extensive model evaluation on training and test set, overall or for specific data slices, using a variety of metrics and visualizations. <br>TFMA provides easy access to [Fairness Indicators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/fairness_indicators): a tool designed to support teams in evaluating and improving models for fairness concerns. <br>You use Fairness Indicators to compute and visualize commonly-identified fairness metrics. \n",

   },
   "source": [
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Civil Comments dataset comprises approximately 2 million public comments that were submitted to the Civil Comments platform. [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/) sponsored the effort to compile and annotate these comments for ongoing [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04561); they've also hosted competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) to help classify toxic comments as well as minimize unintended model bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Civil Comments data, a subset of comments are tagged with a variety of *identity* attributes pertaining to gender, sexual orientation, religion, race, and ethnicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** These identity attributes are intended *for evaluation purposes only*, to assess how well a classifier trained solely on the comment text performs on different tag sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect these identity labels, each comment was reviewed by up to 10 annotators, who were asked to indicate all identities that were mentioned in the comment. For example, annotators were posed the question: \"What genders are mentioned in the comment?\", and asked to choose all of the following categories that were applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Male\n",
    "* Female\n",
    "* Transgender\n",
    "* Other gender\n",
    "* No gender mentioned\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** *We recognize the limitations of the categories used in the original dataset, and acknowledge that these terms do not encompass the full range of vocabulary used in describing gender.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate score for each identity attribute representing the percentage of raters who said the identity was mentioned in the comment. For example, if 10 annotators reviewed a comment, and 6 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"female\" and 0 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"male,\" the comment would receive a `female` score of `0.6` and a `male` score of `0.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For the purposes of annotation, a comment was considered to \"mention\" gender if it contained a comment about gender issues (e.g., a discussion about feminism, wage gap between men and women, transgender rights, etc.), gendered language, or gendered insults. Use of \"he,\" \"she,\" or gendered names (e.g., Donald, Margaret) did not require a gender label. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Label\n",
    "\n",
    "Each comment was rated by up to 10 annotators for toxicity, who each classified it with one of the following ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very Toxic\n",
    "* Toxic\n",
    "* Hard to Say\n",
    "* Not Toxic\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate toxicity \"score\" for each comment (ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`) to serve as the [label](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary?utm_source=Colab&utm_medium=fi-colab&utm_campaign=fi-practicum&utm_content=glossary&utm_term=label#label), representing the fraction of annotators who labeled the comment either \"Very Toxic\" or \"Toxic.\" For example, if 10 annotators rated a comment, and 3 of them labeled it \"Very Toxic\" and 5 of them labeled it \"Toxic\", the comment would receive a toxicity score of `0.8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For more information on the Civil Comments labeling schema, see the [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) section of the Jigsaw Untended Bias in Toxicity Classification Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing the data\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, the data has been pre-processed as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- the colum *toxicity*, i.e. the label, has been converted to a binary label: any value ≥ 0.5 is labeled as 1, i.e. true (i.e., a comment is considered toxic if 50% or more crowd raters labeled it as toxic); vice versa, any value <-.5 is labeled as 0, i.e. false.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- the column *identity* has been grouped by its categories [*gender*, *sexual_orientation*, *disability*, *religion*, *race*] , with a value assigned to the category using a threshold of 0.5. For example, if one comment has `{ male: 0.3, female: 1.0, transgender: 0.0, heterosexual: 0.8, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian: 1.0 }`, data is transformed into `{ gender: [female], sexual_orientation: [heterosexual, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian] }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the *comment_text* column reports the text of the individual comment as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Missing identity fields were converted to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Fairness Indicators currently work with binary and multiclass classification only. "

    "<br> In other words, comments related to the female gender are almost two times more likely than comments overall to be labeled as toxic. This skew suggests that a model trained on this dataset might learn a correlation between gender-related content and toxicity. This raises fairness considerations, as the model might be more likely to classify nontoxic comments as toxic if they contain gender terminology, which could lead to [disparate impact](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary?utm_source=Colab&utm_medium=fi-colab&utm_campaign=fi-practicum&utm_content=glossary&utm_term=disparate-impact#disparate-impact) for gender subgroups. \n",
